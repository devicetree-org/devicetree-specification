Device Node Requirements
========================

Base Device Node Types
----------------------

The sections that follow specify the requirements for the base set of
device nodes required in a |spec|-compliant devicetree.

All devicetrees shall have a root node and the following nodes shall be
present at the root of all devicetrees:

*  One ``/cpus`` node

*  At least one ``/memory`` node

Root node
---------

The devicetree has a single root node of which all other device nodes
are descendants. The full path to the root node is ``/``.

.. note:: All other standard properties
   (:numref:`sect-standard-properties`) are allowed but are optional.

``/aliases`` node
-----------------

A devicetree may have an aliases node (``/aliases``) that defines one or
more alias properties. The alias node shall be at the root of the devicetree
and have the node name ``/aliases``.

Each property of the ``/aliases`` node defines an alias. The property name
specifies the alias name. The property value specifies the full path to
a node in the devicetree. For example, the property serial0 =
``"/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@llc500"`` defines the alias ``serial0``.

Alias names shall be a lowercase text strings of 1 to 31 characters from
the following set of characters.

.. tabularcolumns:: | c p{8cm} |
.. table:: Valid characters for alias names

   ========= ================
   Character Description
   ========= ================
   0-9       digit
   a-z       lowercase letter
   \-        dash
   ========= ================

An alias value is a device path and is encoded as a string. The value
represents the full path to a node, but the path does not need to refer
to a leaf node.

A client program may use an alias property name to refer to a full
device path as all or part of its string value. A client program, when
considering a string as a device path, shall detect and use the alias.

**Example**

.. code-block:: dts

    aliases {
        serial0 = "/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@llc500";
        ethernet0 = "/simple-bus@fe000000/ethernet@31c000";
    };

Given the alias ``serial0``, a client program can look at the ``/aliases`` node
and determine the alias refers to the device path
``/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@llc500``.

``/memory`` node
----------------

A memory device node is required for all devicetrees and describes the
physical memory layout for the system. If a system has multiple ranges
of memory, multiple memory nodes can be created, or the ranges can be
specified in the *reg* property of a single memory node.

The *unit-name* component of the node name
(see :numref:`sect-node-names`)
shall be ``memory``.

The client program may access memory not covered by any memory
reservations (see :numref:`sect-fdt-memory-reservation-block`)
using any storage attributes it chooses. However, before changing the
storage attributes used to access a real page, the client program is
responsible for performing actions required by the architecture and
implementation, possibly including flushing the real page from the
caches. The boot program is responsible for ensuring that, without
taking any action associated with a change in storage attributes, the
client program can safely access all memory (including memory covered by
memory reservations) as WIMG = 0b001x. That is:

* not Write Through Required
* not Caching Inhibited
* Memory Coherence
* Required either not Guarded or Guarded

If the VLE storage attribute is supported, with VLE=0.

.. note:: All other standard properties

``/memory`` node and UEFI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When booting via [UEFI]_, the system memory map is obtained via the
GetMemoryMap() UEFI boot time service as defined in [UEFI]_ ยง 7.2,
and if present, the OS must ignore any ``/memory`` nodes.

``/memory`` Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a 64-bit Power system with the following physical memory layout:

* RAM: starting address 0x0, length 0x80000000 (2 GB)
* RAM: starting address 0x100000000, length 0x100000000 (4 GB)

Memory nodes could be defined as follows, assuming ``#address-cells = <2>``
and ``#size-cells = <2>``.

**Example #1**

.. code-block:: dts

    memory@0 {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x000000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x80000000
               0x000000001 0x00000000 0x00000001 0x00000000>;
    };

**Example #2**

.. code-block:: dts

    memory@0 {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x000000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x80000000>;
    };
    memory@100000000 {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x000000001 0x00000000 0x00000001 0x00000000>;
    };

The ``reg`` property is used to define the address and size of the two
memory ranges. The 2 GB I/O region is skipped. Note that the
``#address-cells`` and ``#size-cells`` properties of the root node specify a
value of 2, which means that two 32-bit cells are required to define the
address and length for the ``reg`` property of the memory node.

``/reserved-memory`` Node
-------------------------

Reserved memory is specified as a node under the ``/reserved-memory`` node.
The operating system shall exclude reserved memory from normal usage.
One can create child nodes describing particular reserved (excluded from
normal use) memory regions.
Such memory regions are usually designed for the special usage by various
device drivers.

Parameters for each memory region can be encoded into the device tree
with the following nodes:

                                               children of root.
   ``#size-cells``     R     ``<u32>``         Specifies the number of ``<u32>`` cells to
                                               represent the size in the ``reg`` property in
                                               children of root.
   ``ranges``          R     ``<prop encoded   This property represents the mapping between
                             array>``          parent address to child address spaces (see
                                               :numref:`sect-standard-properties-ranges`,
                                               ranges).
   Usage legend: R=Required, O=Optional, OR=Optional but Recommended, SD=See Definition
   ===========================================================================================

``#address-cells`` and ``#size-cells`` should use the same values as for the root node,
and ``ranges`` should be empty so that address translation logic works correctly.

/reserved-memory/ child nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each child of the reserved-memory node specifies one or more regions of
reserved memory. Each child node may either use a ``reg`` property to
specify a specific range of reserved memory, or a ``size`` property with
optional constraints to request a dynamically allocated block of memory.

Following the generic-names recommended practice, node names should
reflect the purpose of the node (ie. "*framebuffer*" or "*dma-pool*").
Unit address (``@<address>``) should be appended to the name if the node
is a static allocation.

A reserved memory node requires either a ``reg`` property for static
allocations, or a ``size`` property for dynamics allocations.
Dynamic allocations may use ``alignment`` and ``alloc-ranges`` properties
to constrain where the memory is allocated from.
If both ``reg`` and ``size`` are present, then the region is treated as a
static allocation with the ``reg`` property taking precedence and ``size``
is ignored.

The ``no-map`` and ``reusable`` properties are mutually exclusive and both must
not be used together in the same node.

Linux implementation notes:

- If a ``linux,cma-default`` property is present, then Linux will use the
  region for the default pool of the contiguous memory allocator.

- If a ``linux,dma-default`` property is present, then Linux will use the
  region for the default pool of the consistent DMA allocator.

Device node references to reserved memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regions in the ``/reserved-memory`` node may be referenced by other device
nodes by adding a ``memory-region`` property to the device node.

``/reserved-memory`` and UEFI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When booting via [UEFI]_, static ``/reserved-memory`` regions must
also be listed in the system memory map obtained via the GetMemoryMap()
UEFI boot time service as defined in [UEFI]_ ยง 7.2.
The reserved memory regions need to be included in the UEFI memory map to
protect against allocations by UEFI applications.

Reserved regions with the ``no-map`` property must be listed in the memory
map with type ``EfiReservedMemoryType``.
All other reserved regions must be listed with type ``EfiBootServicesData``.

Dynamic reserved memory regions must not be listed in the [UEFI]_ memory map
because they are allocated by the OS after exiting firmware boot services.

``/reserved-memory`` Example

This example defines 3 contiguous regions are defined for Linux kernel:
one default of all device drivers (named ``linux,cma`` and 64MiB in size),
one dedicated to the framebuffer device (named ``framebuffer@78000000``, 8MiB), and
one for multimedia processing (named ``multimedia@77000000``, 64MiB).

The ``/cpus`` node may contain properties that are common across ``cpu`` nodes.
See :numref:`sect-cpus-cpu-node-properties` for details.

For an example, see :numref:`sect-cpu-node-example`.

``/cpus/cpu*`` Node Properties
------------------------------

A ``cpu`` node represents a hardware execution block that is sufficiently
independent that it is capable of running an operating system without
interfering with other CPUs possibly running other operating systems.

Hardware threads that share an MMU would generally be represented under
one ``cpu`` node. If other more complex CPU topographies are designed, the
binding for the CPU must describe the topography (e.g. threads that
donโt share an MMU).

CPUs and threads are numbered through a unified number-space that should
match as closely as possible the interrupt controllerโs numbering of
CPUs/threads.

Properties that have identical values across ``cpu`` nodes may be placed in
the ``/cpus`` node instead. A client program must first examine a specific
``cpu`` node, but if an expected property is not found then it should look
at the parent ``/cpus`` node. This results in a less verbose representation
of properties which are identical across all CPUs.

The node name for every CPU node should be ``cpu``.

General Properties of ``/cpus/cpu*`` nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the general properties of ``cpu`` nodes. Some
of the properties described in :numref:`table-cpu-node-props` are select
standard properties with specific applicable detail.

                                                   specifies how many cells each element of the
                                                   array takes. Software can determine the number
                                                   of threads by dividing the size of *reg* by

                                                      The CPU is not operational or does not exist.

                                                   A quiescent CPU is in a state where it cannot
                                                   interfere with the normal operation of other
                                                   CPUs, nor can its state be affected by the
                                                   normal operation of other running CPUs, except
                                                   by an explicit method for enabling or
                                                   re-enabling the quiescent CPU (see the
                                                   enable-method property).

                                                   In particular, a running CPU shall be able to

                                                   affecting a quiescent CPU.

                                                   Examples: A quiescent CPU could be in a spin
                                                   loop, held in reset, and electrically isolated

                                                   A CPU with ``"fail"`` status does not affect the
                                                   system in any way.
                                                   The status is assigned to nodes for which no

                                                   ``"spin-table"`` :
                                                      The CPU is enabled with the

Older versions of devicetree may be encountered that contain a
bus-frequency property on CPU nodes. For compatibility, a client-program

identical to that of clock-frequency. The recommended practice is to
represent the frequency of a bus on the bus node using a clock-frequency
property.

Multi-level and Shared Cache Nodes (``/cpus/cpu*/l?-cache``)
------------------------------------------------------------

Processors and systems may implement additional levels of cache hierarchy.
For example, second-level (L2) or third-level (L3) caches.
These caches can potentially be tightly integrated to the CPU or
possibly shared between multiple CPUs.

A device node with a compatible value of ``"cache"`` describes these types
of caches.

The cache node shall define a phandle property, and all cpu nodes or
cache nodes that are associated with or share the cache each shall
contain a next-level-cache property that specifies the phandle to the
cache node.

A cache node may be represented under a CPU node or any other
appropriate location in the devicetree.

Multiple-level and shared caches are represented with the properties in
Table 3-9. The L1 cache properties are described in Table 3-8.

   ``cache-level`` R     ``<u32>``    Specifies the level in the cache hierarchy.
                                      For example, a level 2 cache has a value of 2.
