# FAQ

## Getting the Specification

### Where can I find the latest version of the Devicetree Specification

You can always find the latest released, as well as all older releases,
in our GitHub repository:

[Devicetree Specification release repository](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification-released)

### How often is a new specification released

We're planning to make a v1.0 release by end of August, 2016,
which will be up to date with current core DT bindings used by the Linux kernel.

A second major release is planned for December 2016 to cover new features.

## Governance

### Do I need to be a member to comment and send patches for the Spec?

No. Changes to the spec are proposed and discussed on a 
[public mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#devicetree-spec)
and the source document is hosted in the
[Devicetree Specification](https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification)
project on GitHub.

You can find details about the mailing list and submission process in the [Readme](README.md) file.

### What will membership give me?

Membership gives you a seat on Technical Steering Committee (TSC). 
The TSC is responsible for handling governance issues, 
managing the technical goals, release schedule, 
and helping to define vision for future versions of the spec.

### How is Linaro and devicetree.org connected?

Linaro kick started this process and is hosting devicetree.org under its organisation. 
[devicetree.org](http://devicetree.org) membership fees are associated with devicetree.org
only and not with Linaro membership.
The membership proceeds go towards the defraying of Linaro’s costs for hosting devicetree.org.
